## Todo

- [ ] Update the `Readme.md` file with the syllabus and a brief about the course, and title pointing to the page.
- [ ] Create individual page for each day for eg.: `Day 1 - Refresher to C Programming`, and add the content inside the page.
- [ ] Add code snippets, and important definitions or concepts, so that all the mentors can refer it.
- [ ] Add the GFG, Hackerrank, LeetCode, etc. questions at the end of the page, with redirect link to the question.
- [ ] Finally remove this TodoList.
